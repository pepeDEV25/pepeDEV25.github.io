My name is Žiga Vaupotič, and I am a programmer and mathematician coming from Slovenia. I currently work at the Institute Jožeta Štefana in the E6 laboratory for parallel and distributed systems, where I am involved in research and development of Medusa library. I have written many research papers mainly on the topic of numerical partial defferential equation analysis and functional analysis.

On this page you will find many interesting research topics and programming projects that I am working on or have worked on in the past years.

Žiga Vaupotič.
