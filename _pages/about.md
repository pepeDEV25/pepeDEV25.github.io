My name is Žiga Vaupotič, and I am a programmer and mathematician coming from Slovenia. I currently work at the Institute "Jožef Štefan" in the E6 laboratory for parallel and distributed systems, where I am involved in the research of meshless methods and the development of the Medusa library. I have written a few research papers on the topic of meshless methods, numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics.
On this page, you will find research topics and programming projects that I am working on or have worked on in the past years.
