My name is Žiga Vaupotič, and I am a passionate programmer and mathematician hailing from Slovenia. Currently, I work at the Institute Jožeta Štefana in the E6 laboratory for parallel distributed systems, where I am fortunate to be involved in cutting-edge research and development.

Programming has always been a source of great fascination for me. I find immense joy and fulfillment in creating elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems. While my programming expertise spans various domains, I am particularly drawn to mathematical programming and low-level programming, including reverse engineering.

Mathematics holds a special place in my heart, and I consider it an integral part of my programming journey. I have a profound interest in functional analysis, Sobolev spaces, and partial differential equations.

On this page you will find many intresting research topics and programming projects that I am working on or have worked on in the past years.
