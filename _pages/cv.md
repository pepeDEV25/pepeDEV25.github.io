    - "Jožef Stefan" Institute
    - finalizing PhD research

- October 2017 -- September 2020: PhD student
    - "Jožef Stefan" Institute
    - researching adaptivity in meshless methods
    - working on a library for PDE solving using meshless methods with concrete
applications in fretting fatigue of materials.
    - Supervisor: [dr. Gregor Kosec](http://e6.ijs.si/~gkosec/)

- October 2017 -- May 2021: Teaching assistant
    - Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia

        _"Data structures and algorithms 1 & 2"_,
        _"Databases 1 & 2"_
        _"Numerical mathematics"_

- Summer 2020: PhD Software Engineering Intern
    - Google Inc., remote
    - Developed an obfuscated regex matching engine used for abuse-fighting purposes.

- Summer 2016: Software Engineering Intern
    - Google Inc., Zürich, Switzerland
    - Worked on Gmail Analytics team. I established an end to end anomaly detection
system that analyses billions of time series per day, extracts and orders anomalies
and displays them to the analysts through our frontend.

    - Laboratory for Parallel and Distributed Systems, "Jožef Stefan" Institute
    - Collaborated in a team of three people to develop a production system for Slovenian
Electricity Transmission System Operator to alert of possible icing conditions and calculate
the amount of needed electrical current to prevent it. This included the development of the
mathematical model, implementation, testing against field measurements and numerical testing,
implementation with a web interface for manual simulations and controls, connecting many different
data sources. The system was launched on schedule and runs live without any reported outages.

- Summer 2014: Software Engineering Intern
    - Google Inc., Mountain View, California
    - Worked on Gmail spam detection system. I worked on transitioning the spam
detection system to a new reputation based model, more specifically, I developed
a tool that saves the reputation history of a feature and allows programmatic
access for querying as well as linking it to the frontend tool used by analysts.

- October 2013 -- October 2017:  Student teaching assistant
    - Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia
    - Teaching course "Computing Laboratory" for students of Mathematics and students of Physics.
