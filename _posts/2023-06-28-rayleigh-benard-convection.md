Rayleigh benard convection is known to be unstable for $Ra > 10^7$. Moreover closer that we get to $10^9$ more likely it is for over implicit system to get singular and therefore unsolvable. If the system is solvable it is also likely to be either wrong.

Let $$\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$$ be a bounded smooth domain.
