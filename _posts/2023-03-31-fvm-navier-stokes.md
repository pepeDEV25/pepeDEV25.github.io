# Introduction

In computational fluid dynamic one of four methods is usually used Finite Difference Method (FDM), Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Spectral Methods (SM). Many consider FDM to be the easiest and while this is mainly true, the FDM method has a bit of an issue with complex and unordinary grids. Hence, I believe that instead of FDM, one should use FVM.
