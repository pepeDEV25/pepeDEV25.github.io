## Abstract

In recent years, mesh-free approaches have become a widely used
alternative to conventional methods, such as the Finite Element Method, in solving
numerical scattering problems. In this work a local Radial Basis
Generated-Finite Differences method is used to investigate the electromagnetic
scattering problem of an infinitely long anisotropic circular cylinder, described
by two coupled complex partial differential equations.
The method proves useful for treating the complex valued solutions of the
problem with material discontinuity at the junction between the anisotropic
cylinder and free space. The numerical solution is compared to a known analytical
solution in terms of accuracy and the values of Radar Cross Section.
