## Abstract

The simplicity, generality and efficiency are probably the main attractiveness of the meshless 
methods that have been under intense developed in recent years. This paper considers one of 
those methods, namely a relatively simple Meshless Local Strong form Method (MLSM) [1] that 
generalises  several  other  mesh  based  and  meshless  strong  form  methods,  e.g.  Finite 
Difference  Method,  Local  Radial  Basis  Functions  Method,  Finite  Point  Method,  Diffuse 
Approximate Method, etc. MLSM is based on a Weighted Least Squares (WLS) approximants 
constructed over small local neighbourhood of the considered node. One of the most attractive 
features  of  MLSM  is  its  dependency  solely  on  the  nodal  positions,  which  enables  a  rather general formulation that can be directly implemented in a programming language with support 
for generic abstractions, such as C++11. In another words, the MLSM implementation is not 
dependent on dimensionality of the domain, on the approximation type, basis pool size, basis 
types, support size, and nodal positions. In this paper the generic implementation of MLSM is 
demonstrated by solving various problems in 1D, 2D and 3D on different domain shapes. It is 
shown  that  this  implementation  has  little  to  no  execution  overhead  over  e.g.  classical  Finite Difference Method implementation despite its significant abstraction.
