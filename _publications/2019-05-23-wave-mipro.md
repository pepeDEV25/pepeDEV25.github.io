## Abstract

Simulations of acoustic wave
propagation are an important tool for reconstructing structure of Earth’s
subsurface. The core of such simulations is an efficient and accurate method of
time-domain acoustic
wave simulation in an inhomogeneous domain. Radial Basis Function-generated
Finite Differences (RBF-FD) method is a popular variant of local strong form
meshless
methods that does not require predefined connections between nodes, making it
easier to adapt node distribution to the problem under consideration. This paper
explores RBF-FD as an alternative to traditionally FDM based methods for
time-domain wave propagation. It is demonstrated that RBF-FD provides accurate
results even in challenging cases, where conventional methods struggle to even
obtain a stable solution.
