## Abstract

This paper explores a numerical solution of the three dimensional Boussinesq's
problem. To obtain a solution, the Cauchy-Navier equation is numerically solved
on a variable density nodal distribution with a meshless method. The method is
implemented in C++ programming language with modularity in mind, enabling
construction of many different meshless strong form approaches. It is
demonstrated that such code can be efficiently employed to solve a complex
problem in parallel, using a popular Radial Basis Function-generated Finite
Differences meshless method. Results are presented in terms of von Mises stress
field, convergence behaviour and execution analysis on dual CPU machine with
total of 12 cores.
