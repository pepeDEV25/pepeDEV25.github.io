## Abstract

Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Differences (RBF-FD) is a popular variant of local strong-form meshless methods that do not require a predefined connection between the nodes, making it easier to adapt node-distribution to the problem under consideration. This paper investigates an RBF-FD solution of time-domain acoustic wave propagation in the context of seismic modeling in the Earth's subsurface. Through a number of numerical tests, ranging from homogeneous to highly-heterogeneous velocity models including non-smooth irregular topography, we demonstrate that the present approach can be further generalized to solve large-scale seismic modeling and full waveform inversion problems in arbitrarily complex models enabling more robust interpretations of geophysical observations.
