## Abstract

The  complexity  of  the  electrical  power  systems  and increasing  demands  for  electrical  power constantly  pressure  the  transmission  system  operators  to  utilize  existing  power  lines  more effectively and safely. The transfer capability of the power transmission lines, i.e. the maximal allowed current, is often limited by the maximal temperature of the overhead line that should not be  exceeded  in  order  to  avoid  excessive  sags.  There  has  been  substantial  work  done  on Dynamic  Thermal  Rating  (DTR)  of  overhead  lines  in  last  few  decades,  which  is summarized in leading standards, namely IEC, IEEE and CIGRE. All three standards model the convection as an empirical relation that 
agree well in wind regimes above 0.6 m/s, however, their predictions in low wind regimes differ considerably, which casts doubt on model reliability and consequently diminishes its usability in operative use. Besides, the transmission capacity is often still determined for worst case weather conditions, e.g. ambient temperature of 40deg C, with no rain and no wind.
