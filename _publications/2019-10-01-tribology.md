## Abstract

We present numerical computation of stresses under fretting fatigue conditions derived from closed form expressions. The Navier-Cauchy equations, that govern the problem, are solved with strong and weak form meshless numerical methods. The results are compared to the solution obtained from well-established commercial package ABAQUS, which is based on finite element method (FEM). The results show that the weak form meshless solution exhibits similar behavior as the FEM solution, while, in this particular case, strong form meshless solution performs better in capturing the peak in the surface stress. This is of particular interest in fretting fatigue, since it directly influences crack initiation. The results are presented in terms of von Mises stress contour plots, surface stress profiles, and the convergence plots for all three methods involved in the study.
