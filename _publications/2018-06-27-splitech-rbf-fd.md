## Abstract

Solving PDEs with Radial Basis Functions, especially using local
approaches, has become a promising alternative to the Finite Element
Method. This paper describes one
such approach, a local RBF-FD method, analogous to Finite
Difference Method, that can handle irregular geometries, varying
discretization densities and is easy to implement. RBF-FD method
is analysed by solving basic linear elasticity problems using
uniform and refined discretizations. Finally, a linear elasticity
problem arising from analysis of fretting fatigue is solved and
RBF-FD solution is compared to existing solutions, obtained using
commercial software.
