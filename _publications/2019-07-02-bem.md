## Abstract

Solutions to many physical problems often vary in magnitude throughout the
problem domain. Sometimes, the problematic high intensity areas are known in
advance, but more often they are unknown beforehand. Adaptive techniques for
solving partial differential equations are a standard way of dealing with this
problem, where problematic regions are iteratively refined. A step further is
automatic adaptivity, where problematic regions are chosen automatically using
an error indicator and then refined, until certain error threshold is reached.
We present a recently published technique for automatic adaptivity for strong
form meshless methods and to Poisson equation using the popular RBF-FD method.
Both 2D and 3D cases are considered using uniform and adaptive refinement,
illustrating the advantages of fully automatic adaptivity.
